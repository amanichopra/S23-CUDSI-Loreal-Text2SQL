Even though the number of records is equal to the sum of the number of records in `train_spider.json` and `train_others.json`, it seems to have records in a different order. According to the Spider GitHub [page](https://github.com/taoyds/spider), it's used for evaluation to compare the predicted sql to the true sql. This can probably be generated from the `.json` files depending on how we decide to create our trainining, validation, and testing splits. We can proceed by ignoring this file for now."
